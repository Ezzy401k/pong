# Pong Game

This Python program is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using the Turtle graphics library.

## How it Works

The game consists of two paddles, one on the left and one on the right, and a ball that bounces between them. Players control the paddles to hit the ball and prevent it from passing them. When the ball passes a paddle and reaches the edge of the screen behind it, the opposing player scores a point. The game ends when one player reaches a certain score threshold.

## Features

- Player-controlled paddles for each side.
- A ball that bounces off paddles and screen boundaries.
- Scoring system with a scoreboard.
- Game ends when one player reaches a certain score.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Turtle graphics library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ezzy4001k/pong.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd pong
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python pong.py
```

4. Use the arrow keys or custom controls (e.g., 'w' and 's') to move the paddles and hit the ball.

5. Score points by letting the ball pass the opponent's paddle. The game ends when one player reaches the score threshold.

## Example

```python
python pong.py
```

```
The game starts...
Player 1 scores!
Player 1 wins the game!
```
